        <div class="career">
            My first working experience was when i worked with my uncle in a metal recycling factory in Perak.
            It was a really hard working experience as we had to stand under the sun for very long hours. Then
            I worked in a food processiing factory for some time while waiting for my semester to start. After
            that i worked in a 7-Eleven while studying for a side income. Currently I am working as a apprentice
            software developer.
